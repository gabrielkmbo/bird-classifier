Architecture. What model class did you choose, and why? Did you experiment with different architectures? How did they perform?
In the development of our image processing model, we initially experimented with two distinct architectures: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, after thorough experimentation, we ultimately decided to employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for our model. This decision was influenced by CNN's proven effectiveness in handling image data, its superior performance in feature detection, and its efficiency in training compared to the VAE and GAN for our specific application. 

Training. How did you train your model? What losses did you use and why? What hyperparameters did you tune and what results did you see? How can you explain your choice of hyperparameters?
Our training approach focused on enhancing the model's ability to generalize and adapt to various image characteristics. To achieve this, we employed data augmentation techniques extensively. These techniques included rotating the images, altering color fixation, erasing parts of the images, and performing random flips (both horizontal and vertical). This diversity in training data aimed to mimic a wide range of real-world scenarios, thereby improving the model's robustness and performance in practical applications. The choice of these specific augmentation techniques was guided by their effectiveness in previous studies and their relevance to the nature of the images we expected the model to process.

Results. Did you validate or test your model? Explain your choice of validation and test set. Report and describe strategies to reduce overfitting, if present. Did you conduct any error analysis? Can you hypothesize an explanation for the errors?
In our research, we developed a neural network model and divided our dataset into training and validation sets, with an emphasis on the absence of a distinct test set. This choice limits our ability to evaluate the model's performance on entirely new data, which is crucial for assessing its generalization capabilities. We utilized a 70-30 split for our training and validation sets, a common practice that aids in model tuning and reducing overfitting. To further combat overfitting, we implemented data augmentation techniques such as random flips and color jittering, although we recognize the potential need for more advanced strategies like dropout or weight decay.
Our approach did not include an explicit error analysis, which we acknowledge as a limitation. Error analysis is vital for understanding the nature of the model's misclassifications and for identifying patterns in errors, such as biases towards certain classes or sensitivities to variations in input data. Therefore, we propose that future work should incorporate a separate test set and a comprehensive error analysis post-training. These additions will allow us to better understand where our model is failing and to hypothesize more accurately about the causes of these errors. By addressing these areas, we aim to enhance the robustness and accuracy of our model in bird species classification.
